## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
Implementing Scrum in the IT team of a school startup can greatly enhance productivity by fostering a culture rooted in Scrum’s core values: commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect. These values help the team collaborate effectively, adapt quickly, and deliver high-quality results consistently.
•	Commitment: Scrum encourages the IT team to commit to clear goals each sprint. By setting specific, achievable targets, team members remain dedicated to completing tasks on time, enhancing overall productivity. This commitment ensures that the IT infrastructure is developed systematically, with clear objectives for each sprint.
•	Courage: Scrum fosters a culture of courage, encouraging team members to take risks, experiment with new technologies, and voice concerns. This promotes innovation and ensures that the IT team can adapt quickly to new challenges or evolving infrastructure needs, without fear of failure.
•	Focus: By using sprints, the IT team focuses on delivering incremental improvements to the school’s infrastructure. Scrum’s regular check-ins and short cycles ensure the team avoids distractions and remains aligned with the most important tasks, such as improving network stability or setting up new software systems.
•	Openness: Scrum promotes transparency and communication. Through daily stand-ups and sprint reviews, the IT team shares progress, challenges, and successes. This openness builds trust within the team and with stakeholders, ensuring that everyone is aligned and informed about the state of the project.
•	Respect: Scrum emphasizes mutual respect, where every team member’s opinion is valued, fostering collaboration. By respecting each other's skills and contributions, the team can work together efficiently, solving complex problems in the school’s IT infrastructure.

Scenario 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
1. As a user, I want to search for books by title, author, or genre, so that I can quickly find the books I want to borrow.

2. As a library member, I want to create an account, so that I can borrow books and track my reading history.

3. As a user, I want to view the availability status of books, so that I know if a book is available or currently checked out.

4. As a library member, I want to borrow books online, so that I can reserve books and pick them up from the library without waiting in line.

5. As a user, I want to view a book's details (such as description, author, and publication year), so that I can decide if it interests me before borrowing it.

6. As a library member, I want to receive notifications when a book I have borrowed is due for return, so that I can return it on time and avoid late fees.

7. As a user, I want to see recommendations based on my borrowing history, so that I can discover new books that match my interests.

8. As a librarian, I want to manage book inventories (add/remove books), so that I can keep the library catalog up to date.

9. As a user, I want to place a book on hold if it's currently checked out, so that I can borrow it as soon as it becomes available.

10. As a library member, I want to extend the borrowing period for books, so that I can keep books for a longer time if I need more reading time.
```
